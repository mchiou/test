			<h3>Designers can hustle too...</h3>
				<p>As more designers become founders, there’s a unique opportunity to apply design skills and thinking to the fundraising process. This guide gives a basic overview of the fundraising landscape from a designer’s point of view. It highlights the designer’s advantage when networking, pitching, and closing investment deals. It includes snippets of advice and stories from fellow designer founders. We believe designers have unique abilities that they can leverage when fundraising for their venture.</p>

			<h3>Quick Overview</h3>				
				<p class="section-end">Early stage fundraising occurs in three major phases: incubation phase, seed round, and venture round. Each startup has its unique trajectory through these fundraising phases. Some companies skip incubation and/or the seed round entirely and go straight to the venture round. In the following graphic, we show the funding pathways of some designer founded companies.</p>
				<span class="subhead italicize">Incubation</span>
					<p class="section-end">The incubation phase is the earliest phase of fundraising and its main purpose is to get you off the ground. For the purposes of this guide, we’ve defined the incubation phase as earliest amount raised up to about 500K that is not recognized as an official seed or venture round. The main sources of funding during this phase are friends/family, accelerators, angels, crowdfunding, mechanisms, and yourself.</p>
				<span class="subhead italicize">Seed Round</span>
					<p class="section-end">The seed round follows a period of incubation, usually once there has been some notable traction. This round of funding is more formal that incubation and  therefore comes from more limited range of sources, specifically seed funds, angels and VCs. The purpose of this round is to take you to the next level (i.e., “shift gears”) so that you can hit some significant traction. It’s hard to define these phases by monetary amount because every company is different, but for the purposes of this guide, we’ve defined a seed round to be roughly ~500K - ~1 million.</p>
				<span class="subhead italicize">Venture Round</span>
					<p class="section-end">A venture round is more formal and now-a-days in Silicon Valley, about ~1 million and beyond. Investors such as angels, seed funds, and VCs from the seed round often participate as well as new investors come on. VCs tend to play a larger role than previously. The main goals of the venture round is to scale, take the market share, and/or continue to gain significant traction.</p>

Quite honestly, back then I didn’t even have one percent of the vision I have today. I just thought this was a cool reader tool. People are paying for it. Then, you meet investors and they see slightly further up, they see it’s a platform where people are reading stuff. This is a new platform for the publishing industry. This is the new newsstand. When you start hearing things that it broadens your horizon a bit.  You don’t want to get too ahead of yourselves, but I think meeting with investors helps you think through or fine tune your company story a little bit.&#8221;</blockquote>

			<h3>When to Fundraise</h3>
				<p>When it comes to fundraising, timing is everything. There’s an optimal point in your team and product’s development when it’s best for you to seek funding. At an early stage, the most ideal time for you to fundraise is when you have a solid team, working prototype and some traction.</p>
				<p class="section-end">At the same time, if you have an awesome team with a great track record, you can get away with not building or launching a prototype during the incubation and seed round because investors will be making a bet on you more than anything else. Such talented teams might skip the incubation round altogether and go straight to a seed or venture round, asking for a significant chunk of money before having built anything. The tenets of <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">lean startup</a> would argue, however, that it’s better to stay “lean” and test out your assumptions before committing heavily to investors. In the end, it’s hard to predict the absolute perfect time in your development to fundraise, but here is a quick and simple checklist of what you might need before each fundraising phase:</p>
				<img src="images/where-you-need-to-be.png" alt="where you need to be">
				<p>Note: Remember to incorporate! Incorporation formalizes ownership arrangments, intellectual property (IP), assignments, and allows you to issue stock at low valuations. Some accelerators, like Y combinator, prefer if you do not incorporate. However, you should definitely incorporate before a value is placed on your company, and before you begin the later fundraising stages. </p>

And the first bet that you make on that team is the idea that they have, but they’re also assuming that they can fail at that idea and do another idea. But the second or third round is all about growing the idea because you have traction.  So having some reputation from the past means come on let’s get on with the meetings.&#8221;</blockquote>

				<ol>
					<li>List out all expenses with an expected and worse case. Know company costs health insurance, payroll tax, etc.</li>
					<li>Add a 30 - 50% buffer to your worse case. This buffer covers unforseen costs.</li>
					<li>Align fundraising goals with projected milestones, that way you ask for money at your best moments. Project funding for 18 months.</li>

			<h3>Who to Fundraise From</h3>
			<p class="section-end">Sources of funding range from (1) yourself, (2) friends and family, (3) crowdfunding (4) accelerators, (5) angels, (6) seed funds to (7) VCs. As noted above, different phases involve different funders.</p>
				<span class="subhead italicize">Yourself</span>
					<p>Client work or other jobs may be a way to fund your idea or grow your creative side project into a venture, especially at the very early stages. Other work can act as a safety net of income, and reduces the amount of financial risk you’re taking on. Be warned: working multiple jobs can feel like a large task and lead to burnout. This is also known as <a href="#g_boot">“bootstrapping,”</a> entrepreneurs do whatever it takes for their startup to survive, which can includes taking out loans, opening up credit cards and dipping into personal savings to pursue their idea. </p>
					<p class="section-end">Also, if you start your venture while working for another company, look to make sure that there is no overlap between your anticipated business and your employer’s business. Be careful of any agreements you may have signed with your employer, for you do not want another employer own your work.</p>

						<div class="advantage-pullout">Designer Tip: You have the skills to freelance.</div>
						<p> You have design skills that are usually in high-demand. You can have the flexibility of freelance while testing the waters with entrepreneurship.</p>
					</div>
				<span class="subhead italicize">Friends and Family</span>
					<p>Friends and family are easy to access and tend to be more sympathetic to your needs. The flip side is that they may not be accredited investors, and they’re usually less connected than investors and other mechanisms. You also take the risk of mixing personal with business.</p>

				<span class="subhead italicize">Angels</span>
					<p>Angel investors are a major source of capital during all phases of fundraising. Some angels were once entrepreneurs, so they understand what you’re going through and want to give back. They’re often aligned with the your incentives and care more about your relationship than huge financial returns. Angels can therefore support an entrepreneur who will take a small exit, whereas VCs are incentivized for larger ones.  However, remember that various types of angels, some are familiar with market terms, and others may be new to the startup world.</p>
					<p>They can also invest small amounts of money, which is what you need at an early stage, set direct terms, understand the experimental nature of your idea, and make fast investment decisions. While an angel is a general name for pre-institutional money, angels often come in three flavors:</p>
					<p>Individuals: These angels are accredited independently wealthy investors, who give you money, in exchange for equity or a <a href="#g_convertible">convertible note</a>.</p>
					<p>Network/groups: They sometimes come together to form networks and groups, to share research and consider deals together. Individual angels within networks still make their own investment decisions.</p>
					<p>Funds: Angel funds are groups of investors who pool money to invest together, usually alongside additional investment capital from individual members and limited partners.</p>

					<p>We’ve included these funders who aren’t self-identified as accelerators, angels, or VCs, but provide seed and venture funding. Like VCs, these organizations have limited partners but are smaller scale (in the millions versus in the billions) than large VCs. These funds describe themselves as providing funding in between incubation and later stage funding from traditional, bigger VCs. They tend to be major players during the seed round.</p>

				<p>Your story should include some basic building blocks: characters, conflict, and resolution. It includes your team members, the problem you are trying to solve, and how you plan to solve it. Like in a story, setting is also important as it provides the context and backdrop for all the other components.</p>
				
				<p>Above all, what is your unique position? Known as “positioning” in marketing: How can you position yourself in a unique place in the mind of your audience?</p>
				
				<p>Analogies or one-liners work in this regard, such as making references to established notions: “We’re like Pinterest for your career goals.” In addition to being sticky, they help “de-risk” the idea by linking it to a successful predecessor (such as Pinterest in the former example).</p>

			<span class="subhead italicize">Build Relationships with Investors</span>
				
				<p>Building relationships with investors should start before you begin fundraising, though it does intensify during your fundraising sprint.  Being a part of an established community, such as an accelerator, helps enormously and is one of their main advantages.</p>
				
				<p>At an early stage, the best way to find investors is to leverage existing contacts to schedule friendly meetings - which are not as formal as a pitches  (though you definitely want to show something visual) but more of a meeting in which you ask for advice.</p>
				
				<p>These <a href="#g_friendlies">“friendlies”</a> are particularly effective with angel investors. Follow-up meetings are then opportunities to show a new piece of functionality to your prototype or product or update them on traction (user growth, other investors who have committed).</p>
				
				<p>It’s a subtle courting in which you aren’t directly asking for money, but updating the investor on your progress. If they’re interested, they’ll most likely let you know.</p>
				
				<p>There’s some truth behind the cliche: “Ask for money and get advice; ask for advice and get money.”</p>

				<p>At the same time, after a certain amount of friendlies and follow-ups, a more direct ask (“X investor has agreed to put in, I’m closing the round soon - are you interested?”) might be appropriate.</p>
				
				<p class="section-end">A successful meeting with one investor can snowball into other meetings and opportunities. With every meeting, always ask if there is someone else they recommend you get in touch with. You have to gage from the interaction whether they’re comfortable doing an introduction. Beware of asking for referrals from an investor who has decided not to invest in you.</p>

			<p>Tailor your pitch deck based on your investor’s focus, related investments, and the time you have.</p>		
			<p>Part of your pitch may be a demo of your product. Walk through a user’s thoughts and interactions in a compelling use case. Don’t make the demo too long by going through all possible use cases, just hit on the most compelling aspect for your product. The key is to tell a good story that gives investors a taste but keeps them wanting more.</p>

			<span class="subhead italicize">Negotiate Term Sheets</span>
				<p>A <a href="#g_term">term sheet</a> is a document that contains the terms and conditions of a proposed investment. In the earliest funding stages (less than 1 million), the term sheets will address convertible note financing. In these situations, you would typically be the one serving the term sheet, or the finalized documents, to your investor. In these instances, the process can be less structured as you may be dealing with different types of investors with different experiences and expectations.</p>
				<p>In the later stages of fundraising, term sheets are handed over by investors, and with many VCs, particularly in the Silicon Valley, the term sheet negotiation process has been standardized. Term sheets are conditional offers, and while they are not legally binding, consider it a done deal. It is rare for reputable investors to back out once a term sheet has been given. At the same time, remember that investors will do more research, or <a href="#g_dued">due diligence</a>. Term sheets and due diligence can occur sequentially or in parallel. The terms can change at any time before the deal is closed, and investors may want to renegotiate terms after due diligence findings, so the first round of negotiations generally sets the benchmark the deal. While it’s exciting to get investors on board, negotiate carefully. Certain terms can dilute your equity, so have a good lawyer help you with negotiations, and complete the due diligence process before signing the dotted line.</p>		
				<p>If you are given a term sheet before business diligence has been performed, remember that VCs typically include <a href="#g_noshop">“no-shop agreements,”</a> or stipulations that prevent you from looking for other investors. You want to avoid taking yourself off the market and putting yourself in a vulnerable situation before both you and your investor have completed the due diligence process. </p>		
				<p>A few key areas of negotiation include:</p>		
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#g_valuation">Valuation</a>: The value of your company before investment.</li>
					<li><a href="#g_liquidation">Liquidation Preferences</a>: In the case that your company is liquidated, which can include acquisition, bankruptcy, and the sale of of a company's assets, liquidation preferences state who gets paid first.</li>
					<li><a href="#g_vesting">Vesting Plans</a>: The process where founders and other common stockholders earn their ownership stake over time (usually 2-3 years). This is an investor’s method of ensuring that founders stick around.</li>
					<li><a href="#g_anti">Anti-Dilution Protection</a>: If your company goes through more rounds of funding, anti-dilution provisions prevents an investor’s shares from decreasing in value.</li>
					<li>Board Composition: The board determines the activities of a company. So, who’s on the board, and who keeps control of the board?</li>
				</ul>		
				<p>There are a number of other areas that are addressed in term sheets. For more comprehensive information on term sheets, great resources include Brad Feld’s Term Sheet series, as well as Founder’s Fund termsheet calculator and termsheet explained.</p>

			<span class="subhead italicize">Due Diligence</span>
				<p class="section-end"><a href="#g_dued">Due diligence</a> is the process of thoroughly vetting or understanding the risks of a potential investment. This process goes both ways: investors will perform due diligence on your company and vice versa. The purpose of performing due diligence is so each party knows the relationship they are getting into and there are no subsequent surprises.</p>				
				<h5>Due diligence on your company</h5>				
					<p>An investor will perform two types of due diligence: business diligence and legal diligence. While business diligence can happen in parallel with term sheet negotiations, legal diligence happens after the negotiations.</p>
					<p>With business diligence, an investor wants to affirm the financial health and overall business potential of your company. This process often includes:</p>				
					<ol>
						<li>Evaluation of the team</li>
						<li>Validation of the product</li>
						<li>Size of the market</li>
						<li>Sales and marketing strategy</li>
						<li>Competitive advantage</li>
					</ol>			
					<p>An investor also performs legal diligence to ensure all the business findings are legally supported. This will include documents such as intellectual property agreements, articles of incorporation, ownership information, real estate leases, and more.</p>			
					<p>To get through the due diligence process:</p>
					<ol>

					<p>While investors are conducting due diligence on your company, it is important for you to do sufficient due diligence on a potential investor. Get to know your investor in a variety of settings. Be sure to talk to their portfolio and check references. Through these interactions, you should get a sense of 1. are they reputable and 2. can you work with them? Be sure you know what relationship you’re getting into.</p>				
					<div class="checklist">		
						<span class="subhead italicize">Investor Due Diligence Checklist</span>
						<p>What you should learn through talking to other companies in their portfolio and asking others in the industry.</p>					
						<h5>Money - Do they have the money?</h5>
						<ul>
							<li class="indent">Who controls the money?</li>
							<li class="indent">Who makes the decisions?</li>
							<li class="indent">How much money does an investor have, and how much time do they have? Some investment funds have a limited life times. If you want to possibly get money from an investor in the future, you want to get in early, when an investor still has the money and time.</li>
						</ul>					
						<h5>Strategy - How do I fit with their portfolio?</h5>
						<ul>
							<li class="indent">Are they long-term investors or are they flippers?</li>
							<li class="indent">What’s their track record?</li>
							<li class="indent">What’s their relationship with other investors?</li>
						</ul>					
						<h5>Personality - Can I see them as my boss?</h5>
						<ul>
							<li class="indent">Do they seem excited about your idea?</li>
							<li class="indent">Can they help you when you’re in a tough spot?</li>
							<li class="indent">What’s your personal chemistry?</li>

						<div class="tipquote">&#8220;Because I kept my day job for 9 months after we started, we were able to keep the bills paid, hire an iPhone developer, launch our website and app and build initial traction with users, which was critical for attracting investors as first-time founders. Some investors might consider keeping your day job to show a lack of commitment, but I would argue it depends a lot on the type of day job and other circumstances. In our cases, bootstrapping was critical to getting off the ground.&#8221;</div>
